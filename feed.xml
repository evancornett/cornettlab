Dr. Alison Bates (postdoc) moved on to a research scientist position at Elanco! We moved across the street into the Van Nuys Medical Science Building in the fall, bringing us closer to some of our departmental colleagues and collaborators. Finally, Jocelyne and Christine successfully defended their thesis proposals and passed their qualifying exams. After completing their coursework in the Spring, they will move on to be official candidates for their respective Doctoral degrees! Kudos Jocelyne and Christine. We celebrated with a lab outing to an escape room and randomly drew a celebratory patch for their lab coats!</p>

Despite all the disruptions and chaos, the Cornett lab has a lot to be thankful for this year. 2020 was the year we really became a lab, and it was filled with plenty of firsts! We hosted our first rotation students. Jocelyne and Christine joined as the lab’s first graduate students in the spring. In the summer, we hosted our first intern, Simone. This fall, we welcomed our first undergraduate student, Rebekah Jackson. Rebekah will be with us for a year as a part of the IUPUI Life Health Science Internship (LHSI) program. We also received our first postdoc! Dr. Alison Bates joined in September as a joint postdoc with the Georgiadis Lab. Despite the shutdowns, shipping delays, and occasional quarantine periods, Jocelyne, Christine, Rebekah, and Alison have all made great strides in their projects.</p>

<p>Additionally, 2020 was the year we won our first grant! We are thrilled to be the recipient of two small internal grants. We received a Biomedical Research Grant (BRG) to support our work dissecting the role of lysine methylation in circadian clock regulation. We also received a pilot grant from the IU Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CCBB) to map lysine methylation in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines in collaboration with Dr. Amber Mosley’s group.  We are very grateful for this support!</p>

<p>2020 was undoubtedly a challenging year, but we are incredibly thankful for all of these firsts and are looking forward to all that 2021 has to bring.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
